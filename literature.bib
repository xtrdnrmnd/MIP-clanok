abstract="Developing adaptive, rich-media, eLearning courses tends to be a complex, highly-expensive and time-consuming task. A typical adaptive eLearning course will involve a multi-skilled development team of technologists, instructional developers, subject matter experts and integrators. Even where the adaptive course attempts to reuse existing digital resources, considerable effort is still required in the integration of the adaptive techniques and curriculum. This paper tackles the fundamental challenges of extending adaptivity across not only content (based on prior knowledge, goals, learning styles, connectivity etc.) but also across adaptive pedagogic approaches, communication tools and a range of e-activity types which are required for effective, deeper learning. This paper identifies key activities and requirements for adaptive course construction and presents the design of a tool to allow the rapid construction of such courses. The paper outlines the usage of this tool in the form of a case study and presents its research findings.",

abstract="The development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and eLearning systems has been progressing largely independently over the past several years. Both types of systems have strengths and weaknesses -- ITSs are typically domain specific and rely on concise knowledge modeling and learner modeling, while eLearning systems are deployable in a wide range of circumstances and focus on connecting learners both to content and to one another. This paper provides possibilities for convergence of these two areas, and describes two of our experiences in providing an ITS-style approach to eLearning systems.",

	abstract = {I am excited to present this first installment of a new series in MBE that explores the teaching brain.  The goal of the series is to facilitate a transition in the lens on teaching from an empty vessel to a phenomenon as dynamic, variable and context-dependent as learning.  This transformation will likely push all of us to reevaluate our understanding and research on teaching.  Over the coming year, each issue will provide several articles that seek to shed light on a different aspect of this burgeoning new area of research.  This issue opens the series with a piece designed to lay out the conceptual framework and evidence base for a new way to think about teaching:  the teaching brain.  Next, Michael Chazan gives an archaeological grounding for the existence of teaching in the earliest ancestors of Homo sapiens.  Sidney Strauss and Margalit Ziv then describes how teaching is a fundamental human cognitive ability.  Together, these articles begin to create a paradigm shift in the definition of teaching. We look forward to an exciting journey. },
