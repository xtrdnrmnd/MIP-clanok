abstract="Developing adaptive, rich-media, eLearning courses tends to be a complex, highly-expensive and time-consuming task. A typical adaptive eLearning course will involve a multi-skilled development team of technologists, instructional developers, subject matter experts and integrators. Even where the adaptive course attempts to reuse existing digital resources, considerable effort is still required in the integration of the adaptive techniques and curriculum. This paper tackles the fundamental challenges of extending adaptivity across not only content (based on prior knowledge, goals, learning styles, connectivity etc.) but also across adaptive pedagogic approaches, communication tools and a range of e-activity types which are required for effective, deeper learning. This paper identifies key activities and requirements for adaptive course construction and presents the design of a tool to allow the rapid construction of such courses. The paper outlines the usage of this tool in the form of a case study and presents its research findings.",

abstract="The development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and eLearning systems has been progressing largely independently over the past several years. Both types of systems have strengths and weaknesses -- ITSs are typically domain specific and rely on concise knowledge modeling and learner modeling, while eLearning systems are deployable in a wide range of circumstances and focus on connecting learners both to content and to one another. This paper provides possibilities for convergence of these two areas, and describes two of our experiences in providing an ITS-style approach to eLearning systems.",
